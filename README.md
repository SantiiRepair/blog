## Hi stalkers ⚡

I'm one more boy studying to be a master dev. 

In my free time I enjoy experimenting and I create platform clones that do not have free source code in order to further expand my knowledge and contribute to other people. I keep records of my learning on Gitpod. 🍄 

Ask me about whatever you want. I am interested in helping and sharing.
